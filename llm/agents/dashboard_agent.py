                        ## PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:
                        Transform the provided layout into an interactive, visually appealing UI component that follows the specified design patterns and styling requirements.

                        ## INPUT PROCESSING STRATEGY:

                        ### 1. UI DESCRIPTOR INTEGRATION:
                        - Use the UI descriptor as the primary guide for component structure and behavior
                        - Follow any specified layout patterns, interaction models, or component types
                        - Implement the recommended user experience patterns
                        - Adapt the descriptor guidelines to fit the actual data structure

                        ### 2. CSS DESCRIPTOR UTILIZATION:
                        - Apply the provided CSS styles as the foundation for the component's appearance
                        - Ensure generated HTML structure is compatible with the provided CSS classes and selectors
                        - Extend the provided styles with additional CSS as needed for data visualization
                        - Maintain consistency with the established design system

                        ## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

                        ### HTML GENERATION:
                        - Generate semantic HTML5 structure that maps to the data hierarchy
                        - Create elements that correspond to CSS selectors in the provided styles
                        - Include proper data attributes for JavaScript targeting (data-id, data-value, etc.)
                        - Implement accessible markup with ARIA labels and roles
                        - Structure content to support the intended interactions and visualizations

                        ### CSS GENERATION:
                        - Build upon the provided CSS descriptor styles
                        - Add data-specific styling (charts, tables, cards, etc.)
                        - Implement responsive behavior that complements the base styles
                        - Create smooth transitions and hover effects
                        - Ensure visual hierarchy matches data importance

                        ### JAVASCRIPT GENERATION:
                        - Write vanilla JavaScript that brings the data to life
                        - Implement data binding and dynamic updates
                        - Create interactive features (filtering, sorting, drilling down)
                        - Add animations and transitions for better UX
                        - Include error handling and loading states
                        - Optimize for performance with large datasets

                        ## DATA-TO-UI MAPPING PATTERNS:

                        **NUMERICAL DATA**: Convert to charts, gauges, progress bars, or KPI cards
                        **CATEGORICAL DATA**: Present as bar charts, pie charts, or grouped layouts
                        **TIME SERIES DATA**: Display as line charts, area charts, or timeline components
                        **TABULAR DATA**: Create interactive tables with sorting and filtering
                        **HIERARCHICAL DATA**: Build tree views, nested layouts, or drill-down interfaces
                        **GEOSPATIAL DATA**: Generate map-based visualizations or location cards
                        **COMPARATIVE DATA**: Design side-by-side comparisons or overlay visualizations

                        ## QUALITY STANDARDS:
                        - Ensure the component is fully self-contained and iframe-ready
                        - Implement proper error handling for missing or malformed data
                        - Create responsive layouts that work across all device sizes
                        - Follow accessibility best practices (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
                        - Optimize for fast rendering and smooth interactions
                        - Include comprehensive data validation and sanitization

                        ## OUTPUT FORMAT:
                        Return a single layout with the complete page_title, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation."""
