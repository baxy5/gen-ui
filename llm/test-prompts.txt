Line Chart Prompts --------------------------
"Create a line chart showing hemoglobin levels over time from 2021 to 2025, with the reference range displayed as a shaded area."
"Generate a line chart to track cholesterol levels (total, HDL, LDL) across all test dates with different colored lines for each type."
"Create a multi-line chart showing white blood cell count (WBC) trends over time, with a separate line for the patient's average."

Bar Chart Prompts --------------------------
"Create a bar chart comparing the most recent liver enzyme values (GOT, GPT, GGT, ALP) to their reference ranges."
"Generate a grouped bar chart showing electrolyte levels (Na, K) from the last three test dates."
"Create a horizontal bar chart of all flagged test values from the most recent test, sorted by percentage deviation from the normal range."

Area Chart Prompts --------------------------
"Create an area chart showing blood glucose levels over time with colored zones indicating normal, elevated, and high ranges."
"Generate a stacked area chart showing the proportions of different white blood cell types (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes) across all test dates."
"Create an area chart displaying total cholesterol with HDL and LDL components stacked, tracking changes from 2021 to 2025."

Composed Chart Prompts --------------------------
"Create a composed chart with bars showing liver enzyme levels and a line showing total bilirubin across all test dates."
"Generate a chart with LDL cholesterol as bars and triglycerides as a line graph to track cardiovascular risk factors over time."
"Create a composed chart with blood cell counts as bars and hemoglobin as a line to visualize overall blood health from 2021 to 2025."

Scatter Chart Prompts --------------------------
"Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between LDL cholesterol and triglycerides across all test dates."
"Generate a scatter chart plotting hemoglobin values against red blood cell count with points sized by MCV value."
"Create a bubble chart with neutrophil count on the x-axis, lymphocyte count on the y-axis, and bubble size representing white blood cell count."

Pie Chart Prompts --------------------------
"Create a pie chart showing the distribution of different white blood cell types (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils) from the most recent test."
"Generate a pie chart displaying the proportion of normal vs. abnormal test results from the April 2025 blood panel."
"Create a donut chart showing cholesterol composition (HDL, LDL, and remaining) as percentages of total cholesterol."

Radar Chart Prompts --------------------------
"Create a radar chart comparing key blood metrics (hemoglobin, WBC, platelets, glucose, creatinine) against their reference midpoints."
"Generate a radar chart showing how liver function tests (GOT, GPT, GGT, ALP, Bilirubin) compare between the 2023 and 2025 tests."
"Create a multi-radar chart comparing complete blood count parameters across three test dates, with each parameter normalized to its reference range."
